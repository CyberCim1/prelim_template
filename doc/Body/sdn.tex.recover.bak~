Web servers \& sdn (no loss in availability) \\
Web server sdn and containers (isolation to prevent network traversal) 

The preliminary results from \gls{dim} demonstrated the limitations of using traditional firewall software as a MTD mechanism for web servers. \gls{sdn} has emerged as a driving factor in many \gls{mtd} solutions \cite{ddosSDN,Chowdhary:mason, Hong2017OptimalNR} \todo{add more citations}, due to the flexibility in network configurations and granular traffic control. These works have promising results that SDN could serve as the rotational mechanism between web servers. 

based o the preliminary findings in \ref{dim}, I plan to conduct two additional phases in my research: 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item investigate alternative solutions & compare the results
	\item investigate the minimum frequency & diversity required to thwart attacks 
\end{enumerate}

The initial study explained in section \ref{dim}, uses a traditional forwarding method to rotate between web servers. To study the feasibility of applying \gls{mtd} to web servers i plan to replicate the study with the following changes.

\subsubsection{Consider the forwarding mechanism of \gls{sdn}}: The new solution should decrease the packet loss, thus minimize the impact on the user will experience. 

\subsection{Consider isolating the web servers}: One observation in the \gls{dim} results (shown in section \ref{)
